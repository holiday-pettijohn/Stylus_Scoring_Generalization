# Generalizing the Stylus character scoring system using neural networks and visual analysis

In order to generate the binary drawing representations of the genes in './Genes', run './xmlparse.py' on the command line

This will add said bitmap files to the './HanBitmap' directory, which Networks.ipynb actively references

In order to use the training data provided by Dr. Axe, download 'training set.zip' into the './Genes' directory and unzip it

Also place the references, which are contained in 'hans.zip', into the directory './Reference'. Make sure the folders named '4000', '5000', etc... are directly under './Reference' and not in a further nested directory.
